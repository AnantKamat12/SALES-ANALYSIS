## Description
This project explores sales data using **Excel** and **Power BI**, with the goal of identifying trends in customer demographics, regional performance, and platform contributions. The analysis includes pivot tables, charts, and an interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers for dynamic insights.

## Data
- **Excel Dataset:** RAW_DATA.xlsx  
- **Power BI Dataset:** SuperStore Sales DataSet.xlsx  
- **Columns:** Customer Gender, Age, State, Product, Platform, Sales Amount, and more.

2. **Exploratory Analysis in Excel:** Created pivot tables and charts summarizing sales by gender, age group, state, and platform.
3. **Power BI Analysis:** Imported *SuperStore Sales DataSet.xlsx*, performed transformations in Power Query, created relationships, and built interactive visuals.
